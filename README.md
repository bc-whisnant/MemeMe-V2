1) Make a meme by selecting an existing image from the library or taking a picture with the camera and adding text via the top and bottom label
2) Share the meme via UIActivityView.
3) The memes are then shown in a table or collection view - the user can select which view they would like.
4) The meme can then be selected from either table or collection view for further investigation.
